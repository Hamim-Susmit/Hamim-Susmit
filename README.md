# 👋 Hi, I’m Hamim Susmit (Hamim-Susmit)

I’m a data enthusiast who loves exploring real-world datasets to answer business questions and deliver insights. I build SQL analytics solutions, conduct exploratory data analysis, create predictive models, and design dashboards that help people understand what’s happening behind the numbers — all in a way that’s practical, reproducible, and easy to follow.

## 🚀 What I Work On

I primarily work with:

- 📊 **Python** — data cleaning, analysis, modeling  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** — churn prediction, lifetime value  
- 🛢️ **SQL** — advanced analytics queries that drive business decisions  
- 📈 **Dashboards & Visualization** — making insights accessible

My projects tend to focus on customer behavior, revenue analysis, segmentation, and retention — the kinds of things analysts and data teams work with every day.

## 📚 Portfolio Highlights

### 🛍️ **Retail & Business Analytics**

- **E-Commerce Sales EDA (`online-retail-ii-eda`)**  
  Exploratory Data Analysis on a real online retail dataset — uncovering trends, seasonality, and customer patterns that set the stage for deeper analytics.

- **SQL-Driven Analytics (`online-retail-ii-sql-analytics`)**  
  Business analytics written entirely in SQL — answering strategic questions about revenue, customer segments, and key performance metrics using real sales data.

### 🤝 **Customer Intelligence & Segmentation**

- **Customer Segmentation & Lifecycle (`customer-segmentation-lifecycle-analysis`)**  
  A pipeline that breaks customers into segments (e.g., high-value vs. at-risk) using RFM analysis and clustering, helping businesses tailor strategies by customer type.

---

### 🔁 **Retention & Prediction**

- **Churn Prediction & CLV Modeling (`customer-churn-clv-online-retail-ii`)**  
  Predicts which customers are likely to churn and estimates Customer Lifetime Value — combining modeling and business logic to guide retention decisions.

- **Retention Strategy Simulation (`customer-retention-strategy-online-retail-ii`)**  
  Simulation of retention strategies + analysis of their effectiveness using business-relevant metrics.

---

### 📊 **Interactive Tools & Dashboards**

- **Customer Intelligence Dashboard (`customer-intelligence-dashboard-online-retail-ii`)**  
  An interactive dashboard (e.g., built with Streamlit) that lets you explore customer segments, churn risk, and revenue drivers — great for both self-service analysis and executive reporting.
